Policy tools serve as the primary instruments through which governments achieve governance objectives, directly shaping the effectiveness and impact of public policy implementation. Existing studies lack a systematic, multidimensional analysis of policy tools, limiting the ability of single-dimensional studies to capture their complexity and diversity. To address this gap, this study proposes a policy tool attention index constructed through a three-dimensional analytical framework of frequency, effectiveness, and positional. This framework enables a quantitative assessment of the attention characteristics of policy tools across multiple dimensions. Findings reveal that supply-oriented and environmental policy tools dominate China’s scientific and technological innovation policies, reflecting a governmental preference for fostering innovation through direct resource allocation and environmental optimization. In contrast, demand-oriented policy tools and international governance tools receive comparatively less attention. To enhance the overall efficacy of the innovation system, future policies should pursue a more balanced configuration of policy tools, emphasizing strengthened market demand-driven mechanisms and enhanced international cooperation.
