Expressions of public views on climate risk and corresponding government responses serve as crucial indicators of the dynamic interaction between the public and the government in tackling climate change. Focusing on the context of China, this study utilizes word embedding techniques to construct indices of expressions of public views and government responses on climate risk at the national, provincial, and city levels for the first time. These indices are derived from data collected on the Message Board for Leaders platform spanning from January 2011 to December 2023. The developed indices not only facilitate the study of expressions of public views and government responses to climate risk but also provide robust data support for enhancing climate risk communication between the government and the public. Furthermore, these indices are instrumental in bolstering regional climate adaptation initiatives and accelerating the development of climate-resilient cities.
