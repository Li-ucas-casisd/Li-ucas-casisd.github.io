Effective emergency material reserve systems are vital for enhancing urban resilience to climate-induced disasters. This paper develops an integrated DEMATEL-ANP (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory–Analytic Network Process) model to identify and prioritize critical indicators influencing the sustainability of emergency material reserves. By capturing both causal relationships and interdependencies among criteria, the proposed framework supports multi-dimensional risk-informed decision-making under uncertainty. The methodology is applied to a real-world case in China, revealing key leverage points for policy intervention—such as inventory adaptability, inter-agency coordination, and dynamic replenishment mechanisms. The results provide actionable insights for optimizing strategic reserve allocation and strengthening systemic resilience in public emergency management.
